Dietopedia is a website that helps its users to plan their daily meal based on the
total calorie required based upon their BMR.Upon joining,they will be provided
with different dishes to choose from, listed as per their calorie goal.Nepalese aren’t
really concerned about the quality and quantity of food they eat. Their food
preferences are biased by cultural aspect, taste and economic aspect. Thus it
is a quiet alarming but less concerned problem that Nepalese society face. Our
project helps people to be aware of what they eat, the amount they eat and about
their family’s necessity. There are some foreign websites that does similar calorie
calculation for a person to consume in a daily life but the foods calories they show
isn’t quiet suitable for us due to difference in lifestyle. And we haven’t encountered
any website that’s based in Nepal and serves our very purpose.

Objectives:

This research work is conducted in order to:

• To build the clean responsive website

• Provide consumers instant access and a quicker purchase to healthier meal
plan with a medium to show calories intake
